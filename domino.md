===========

__This is a timed 50 minute exercise.__


### Task

### UI Mockup

### Component requirements

1.  Dominos can have 0 to 6 (inclusive) dots on a face.
2.  Clicking the "Generate" button will populate the domino with a random number of dots on each of the 2 faces.
3.  Clicking the "Rotate Left" or "Rotate Right" buttons will rotate the domino left or right. (Hint: You can use CSS transforms to achieve the rotation.)
4.  [Optional] Make it pretty.

### Code requirements

1.  You can use base JavaScript libraries such as jQuery, underscore.js, Backbone.js, etc.
2.  Submit code in a [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net) so that it can be easily viewed and analyzed.

### Evaluation

In addition to the correctness of your solution, the style and architecture of your code will also be evaluated.
